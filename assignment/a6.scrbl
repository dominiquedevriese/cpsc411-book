@title[#:tag "top" #:tag-prefix "a6:"]{Milestone 6: Adding Return}

@section{Assignment Summary}

The goal of this assignment is to introduce the procedure return abstraction and
non-tail calls, so that we can call functions that return values to non-tail
contexts.

This assignment is due @(due 'a6).

You can use the interrogator to get limited access to the reference solution:
@url{https://www.students.cs.ubc.ca/~cs-411/2020w2/interrogator.cgi?an=a6}.

@section{Reading}
The reading for this week is @Secref[#:tag-prefixes '("book:"

As usual, this milestone description links to the documentation for each
exercise in the chapter for convenience, but you are responsible for the
reading the entire chapter.

@section{Exercises}

@exercise{Extend @racket[check-values-lang] to validate the safety
of source programs.
Remember that you will have to reject some safe programs.
}

@exercise{Extend @racket[uniquify] to support procedure calls in the source
language.
}

@exercise{Extend @racket[sequentialize-let] with non-tail calls.}

@exercise{Extend @racket[impose-calling-conventions] with support for non-tail
calls and return.

You should use @racket[current-return-address-register] and
@racket[current-return-value-register] rather than hard-coding the calling
convention registers.
}

@exercise{Extend @racket[canonicalize-bind] with support for return points.}

@exercise{Extend @racket[select-instructions] with support for return points.}

@exercise{Extend @racket[uncover-locals] with support for return points.}

@exercise{Extend @racket[undead-analysis] with support for return points.

@margin-note{
Hint:

The simplest way to get the @asm-pred-lang-v6/undead[call-undead] locations is
to use a single mutable variable that is local to the helper function that
processes definition.
See @racket[box]
}

}

@exercise{Extend @racket[conflict-analysis] with support for return points.}

@exercise{Design and implement @racket[assign-call-undead-variables].}

@exercise{Design and implement @racket[allocate-frames].}

@exercise{Extend @racket[assign-registers] to avoid directly implementing
spilling.

You may be able to reuse a lot of code from
@racket[assign-call-undead-variables], if abstracted properly.

It might help to re-imagine the "pick a low-degree variable" progress in the
allocation algorithm as a sorting problem.
If the variables are sorted in degree order, then the core assignment algorithm
doesn't need to know about degrees---it always picks the first variable in the
sorted list.
See @racket[sort].

Be careful when computing which registers cannot be used; your conflict graph
contains a mix of abstract locations and registers.

You may still find it useful to use a single mutable variable to collect
spilled variables.

You should use the parameter @racket[current-assignable-registers].
}

@exercise{Design and implement @racket[assign-frame-variables].

Be careful when computing which frame variables cannot be used; your conflict
graph contains a mix of abstract locations and frame locations.}

@exercise{Extend @racket[replace-locations] to support return points and
non-tail calls.}

@;@challenge{Design and implement @racket[optimize-moves] to optimize
@;@tech{Para-asm-lang v6}.
@;
@;@itemlist[
@;@item{Replace all instructions of the form @object-code{(set! rloc_1 rloc_1)}.
@;with @object-code{(nop)}, which must be added to all subsequent languages.
@;This instruction should generate an empty string in x64.}
@;
@;@item{Rewrite instructions of the form @object-code{(set! rloc_1 (binop rloc_2
@;rloc_1))} to @object-code{(set! rloc_1 (binop rloc_1 rloc_2))}, where
@;@object-code{binop} is commutative.
@;This will help @racket[patch-instructions] produce better code.}
@;]
@;}

@exercise{Extend @racket[expose-basic-blocks] to implement the return point
abstraction.}

@exercise{Extend @racket[implement-fvars] to correctly implement frame variables
relative to the current value of the
@racket[current-frame-base-pointer-register].

You should use an accumulator representing the current offset from the current
block's frame.
You may want to use @racket[fvar->addr].

You shouldn't assume that the @racket[current-frame-base-pointer-register] is
@paren-x64-v6[rbp], and should use the parameter instead.
}

@exercise{Modify @racket[patch-instructions] to support instructions with
@para-asm-lang-v6[addr]s instead of @nested-asm-lang-fvars-v6[fvars].}

@exercise{Extend @racket[generate-x64] to support the the new @paren-x64-v6[binop].}
